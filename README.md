ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm CodeSoft!
ðŸ’» My website is under development, and you can see it at codesoft.ga! ((Freenom got sued by meta)[https://www.linux.org/threads/sued-by-meta-freenom-halts-domain-registrations.44195/], so go to https://website.codesoftgames.repl.co/)
I usually code in scratch and python, but occasionally do the 3 C languages and JS.
